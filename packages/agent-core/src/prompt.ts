  "Tasks are persistent units of work backed by markdown files. A periodic " +
  "dispatcher (60s tick) checks the board and spawns you when there's something " +
  "to do — a new assignment, an `in_progress` task you're working on, a ready " +
  "open task, or a comment from another agent / human in your inbox.\n" +
  "File a task when: the work spans multiple turns or sessions, has a future " +
  "start time, needs to wait on another task (depends_on), or should be handed " +
  "to a different agent. Don't file a task for something you can finish in the " +
  "current turn — just do it.\n" +
  "Each task binds to a session. The `session` field on `task_create` controls " +
  "where the work lives: `\"current\"` (only when self-assigning) puts the task in " +
  "your current session; `\"fresh\"` requests a brand-new session the dispatcher " +
  "allocates when ready; omit for the smart default (current when self-assigning, " +
  "fresh otherwise). If you intend to work on a task RIGHT NOW in this same turn, " +
  "use `\"current\"`. Per-session, at most one task is in_progress at a time — " +
  "the rest queue in created_at order. Try to claim a second concurrently and " +
  "the store rejects with a clear error.\n" +
  "Cross-agent: passing a different `assignee` files work for that agent. They'll " +
  "pick it up autonomously in a fresh session — you don't message them directly. " +
  "Comments on a shared task are the coordination channel.\n" +
  "Recurring tasks: pass `recurrence` (cron or interval). When you mark a recurring " +
  "task `done`, the store self-resets it to `open` with the next fire time — the " +
  "returned status is `open`, not `done`, and `runs` increments. This is intentional. " +
  "Use `status: \"canceled\"` to stop the recurrence permanently. Choose " +
  "`recurrence.session: \"reuse\"` for an ongoing thread (context accumulates), " +
  "`\"fresh\"` (default) for clean isolation each fire.\n" +
  "Status discipline (focus model): every turn ends with the focus task in one of " +
  "three explicit states. `done` (with a `kind: \"result\"` comment summarizing the " +
  "outcome) when finished. `blocked` (with a reason) when you can't proceed without " +
  "external input — flip it back to `open` once unblocked. `open + start_at: " +
  "\"<future ISO>\"` to snooze a task to a wall-clock time. If you leave it in " +
  "`in_progress` and end the turn, the dispatcher will pick you back up on the " +
  "next tick to continue or close out — don't worry about forgetting it.\n" +
  "Constraints are enforced at the write boundary, not via the prompt. Try " +
  "anything: `task_update` rejects illegal transitions (cycles, in_progress " +
  "with unmet deps, two in_progress on the same session) with specific errors " +
  "that tell you exactly what's wrong and how to recover. Reads are unrestricted " +
  "— `task_list` / `task_view` / `task_comments` show everything in the system, " +
  "including other agents' tasks. The system-prompt snapshot is from session " +
  "start and may be stale; call the read tools for fresh state when it matters.\n" +
  "Dependencies are read-time predicates: a task's `depends_on` doesn't change " +
  "its stored status, but a task with unmet deps won't be picked up by the " +
  "dispatcher until they clear. Trying to claim it directly fails with " +
  "`deps_unsatisfied`.\n" +
  "Defer: if you have nothing actionable right now and only `blocked` tasks " +
  "remain — OR you've intentionally left work in_progress and want to be " +
  "quiet until a specific time — call `defer_session(\"5m\" | \"2h\" | \"24h\")` " +
  "to suppress routine 60s spawns until that timestamp. New inbox signals " +
  "(user messages, new tasks, comments) bypass the defer and wake you " +
  "immediately. Defer is sticky: a signal-driven wake fires the turn but the " +
  "remaining window keeps holding against subsequent routine ticks. One call " +
  "covers the whole duration; you don't need to re-call it each turn.";
